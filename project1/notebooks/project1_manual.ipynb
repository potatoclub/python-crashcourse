    "You will be designing a terminal-based application that reads text files, displays statistics about the content of the file, and edits the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be three major functions for you to implement:\n",
    "1. _frequency()_, which accepts a string of text as a parameter and returns a dictionary, containing every word in the string, as the key, and the number of times the word appears in the string as the value.\n",
    "2. _top10()_ accepts a string of text as a parameter and returns a list of 2-tuples, representing the top ten most frequently appearing words from the string (or less, if there are fewer than ten unique words) and their frequency.\n",
    "3. _replace\\_word()_ accepts three parameters, one is a string of text, one is a string with a word to be replaced in the text, the last is a string with the world to replace it with. The function will replace all occurrences of a word with the replacement word.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need to build a user-interface in the termal for the user to execute and see the results of each function.\n"
